Note that some labs will consist of paper discussions or classroom exercise with computers rather than hands-on exercises. **For paper discussions, students must come to class prepared to discuss the assigned paper.** Responses to paper discussions will be completed prior to class and turned in at the end of the class period on the day that the paper is discussed.\n",

Prior to the final project report due, students will need to turn in their project idea and a one-pager of their project report in weeks 5 and 10, respectively. These will be commented, and students will be expected to incorporate comments into the final version. The final project report will be due at the end of the semester and will include introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections. Class time will be devoted to discussion of results, and students are encouraged to discuss the project outside of class to formulate hypotheses and conclusions.\n",

There may be aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course.  I invite any student to contact me to discuss strategies and/or accommodations (academic adjustments) that may be essential to your success and to collaborate with the Center for Disability Resources (CDR) in this process. If you would like to discuss disability-accommodations or register with CDR, please visit [Center for Disability Resources](https://disabilityservices.syr.edu/){target=_blank}. Please call (315) 443-4498 or email disabilityresources@syr.edu for more detailed information. The CDR is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic accommodations and will work with the student to develop an access plan. Academic accommodations, such as exam administration, are not provided retroactively; therefore, planning for accommodations as early as possible is necessary.\n",

    "### Academic Integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "Syracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy reflects the high value that we, as a university community, place on honesty in academic work. The policy defines our expectations for academic honesty and holds students accountable for the integrity of all work they submit. Students should understand that it is their responsibility to learn about course-specific expectations, as well as about university-wide academic integrity expectations. The policy governs appropriate citation and use of sources, the integrity of work submitted in exams and assignments, and the veracity of signatures on attendance sheets and other verification of participation in class activities. The policy also prohibits students from submitting the same work in more than one class without receiving written authorization in advance from both instructors. Under the policy, students found in violation are subject to grade sanctions determined by the course instructor and non-grade sanctions determined by the School or College where the course is offered as described in the Violation and Sanction Classification Rubric. Syracuse University students are required to read an online summary of the University’s academic integrity expectations and provide an electronic signature agreeing to abide by them twice a year during pre-term check- in on MySlice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Violation and Sanction Classification Rubric establishes recommended guidelines for the determination of grade penalties by faculty and instructors, while also giving them discretion to select the grade penalty they believe most suitable, including course failure, regardless of violation level. Any established violation in this course may result in course failure regardless of violation level.\n",
    "\n",
    "All academic integrity expectations that apply to in-person quizzes and exams also apply to online quizzes and exams. In this course, all work submitted for quizzes and exams must be yours alone. ***Discussing quiz or exam questions with anyone during the quiz or exam period violates academic integrity expectations for this course.*** Using websites that charge fees or require uploading of course material (e.g., Chegg, Course Hero) to obtain exam solutions or assignments completed by others and present the work as your own violates academic integrity expectations in this course.\n",

Syracuse University does not set aside non-instructional days for any religious holiday. Students must notify instructors by the end of the second week of classes when they will be observing their religious holiday(s). Students will have access to an online notification form through MySlice for two weeks beginning on the first day of class. Once I have been notified of your intention to be absent for a religious observance, I will work with you directly to find a way to accommodate your absence.\n",

    "Excuses for class absences for medical reasons will be given only if such absences are advised by a health care provider at the Health Center, based on clinical findings and prescribed treatment recommendations. Excused notes will not be given solely to confirm a visit to the Health Center.
