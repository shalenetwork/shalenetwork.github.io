By collecting water samples and using water monitoring equipment at Black Moshannon State Park, State College Area High School students have been learning how the environment affects water quality.

Through the Teen Shale Network, the earth science high school students have been able to get involved in research on Marcellus Shale. They are working with the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute at Penn State and workers from Shale Network and the NSF-funded Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (HOTLLINK) to gather baseline data on the water quality at Black Moshannon river to understand if downstream shale gas wells have any effect. The students have made four trips to the park and will present the data at the Shale Network Conference May 8 and 9 at Penn State.
