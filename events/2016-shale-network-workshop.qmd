**Science and cooperation around water quality data and legacy wells in shale gas basins**

The fifth annual Shale Network workshop took place May 19 and 20, drawing a large, diverse group including government workers, industry representatives, environmental group members, students and academics. About 97 people attended all or parts of the workshop, including a field trip, poster session, computer module and daylong session of presentations and discussions. 

Of the 97 participants: 36 were from academia, including representatives from Princeton University, Penn State University, the University of Pittsburgh, the Colorado School of Mines, Binghamton University and Duquesne University; 18 were from government agencies, including the US Geological Survey, the US Department of Energy, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, and the Maryland Department of the Environment; 11 were from environmental groups/non-profit groups, including Trout Unlimited, Friends for Environmental Justice and the Centre County Pennsylvania Senior Environmental Corps; seven were consultants or representing industry, including Shell, Chesapeake Energy, and Leidos; 17 were State College high school students and eight were members of the Shale Network committee.

We appreciated everyone’s contributions, and are thankful for another great workshop.

**Date(s):**

May 19 and 20, 2016

**Location:**

Atherton Hotel, State College, PA. (Adjacent to the Penn State University Park campus.)

**About the Workshop**

All participants took part in sharing and interpreting water quality and quantity data related to shale gas development.

The Shale Network is a collaborative effort between Penn State, Pitt, Dickinson and the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences Inc. (CUAHSI) to collect and analyze data on water quality in the Marcellus Shale drilling region. The workshop provided an opportunity for nonscientists, researchers, experts, government officials, and members of the gas and environmental industries to compare lessons learned about water issues within the northeastern region of shale gas development.
