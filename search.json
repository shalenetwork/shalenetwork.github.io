    "text": "RUSH TOWNSHIP, Pa. – The boots Maria Rodriguez-Hertz wore kept out the water but not the numbing cold from Black Moshannon Creek.\nRodriguez-Hertz, a State College high school sophomore, waded into the stream along with her classmates to collect water samples and record data for the TeenShale Network.\nThe network is a collaboration between Penn State researchers and high school science students and teachers. Together, they monitor the stream for potential environmental impacts, such as from Marcellus Shale gas drilling.\nWith the help of the students, the network is growing.\nLast year, students collected data from only one site. This year, two new sites were added downstream, strategically chosen because they are close to Marcellus Shale well pads.\n“Having multiple locations lets students see how the water changes as it flows downstream and is exposed to both natural and man-made influences,” said Penn State researcher Jennifer Williams. “I think it’s incredibly valuable for the students to see how one site at a local state park that is considered pristine and utilized in a variety of different ways can change over its course of reach downstream as it passed through our community.”\nNearby Marcellus Shale wells are one possible man-made influence. To get the gas out of the ground, a process is used called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. This process is controversial and scientists have been studying its possible environmental impact.\nThe students are providing scientists with baseline data on what the stream looks like now, which can be used as a reference to examine possible future impacts.\nTo make these measurements, TeenShale Network is able to use professional scientific equipment thanks to its partnership with Earth and Environmental Systems Institute at Penn State. In return, the students provide Penn State with valuable data, which goes into a large database available to researchers.\n“It gives you a real science experience you don’t get in the classroom,” said Alison Weiss, an eighth-grader. “I learned what it is like to take actual measurements instead of projects that have already been recorded in class.”\nEighth-graders like Weiss participated in the network this year for the first time. Previously, only ninth-grade students were involved. Some of those students, now in 10th grade, also returned for another year. This gives newer students the chance to learn valuable skills from their older counterparts. Also, it gives the older students the ability to teach others about what they have already learned.\n“I’m there to point students in the right direction,” said Lena Nyblade, a 10th-grader who returned for a second year and took on a leadership role with her younger classmates. The older students have shown their classmates how to use and read equipment in the field and have gained new experience thinking about the project in a different way.\nThe younger students like eighth grader Aaron Li got a preview of the type of science they will continue to learn in high school.\n“I wanted to increase my knowledge about the subject that I didn’t know much about before,” Li said. “I hope to get more experience in hands-on activities.”\nIn the field, Nyblade and the other 10th-graders showed their classmates how to use equipment, like the water-quality sensor called the Horiba U-53. The sensor is used to measure pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen content and other data that are indicators of the health of the stream.\nThe students also waded out into the water to use equipment called a Flow Tracker to measure the flow and depth of the creek and to collect samples to send back to Penn State for testing. Williams said they are the same types of experiments professional scientists do in the field.\nStudent said testing and sampling in the field is much different than in the classroom, where experiments often have predictable answers.\n“In labs in class, everything is usually a lot more controlled,” Rodriguez-Hertz said. “There aren’t many variables, but here there are many variables that you have to think about.”\nStudents had to take into account things like the changing weather they experienced during their eight field trips from the fall through late April. The climate was different on each of the trips, and that greatly influenced the stream and the accessibility of the sites.\nIn the winter, deep snow covered many of the sites, and some trips had to be canceled. When the snow began to melt, the stream was very high and fast moving. Students had to consider things like whether salt added to the roads over winter would make its way into the streams and affect their data by changing electrical conductivity and chemical composition.\n“In the classroom setting labs and activities have parameters that are predictable with some aspects of discovery,” said Phil Gipe, a ninth-grade earth science teacher. “In real life, scientific field studies, like what we’re doing here, many unknowns creep in such as logistics, supplies, organization, boots that leak, unforeseen challenges and problem solving. A project such as this really mirrors real life science in the field, science as it currently is.”\nThe students spent class time during the year analyzing and graphing their data. They presented their findings and their goals for next year at the annual Shale Network Workshop in May in State College.\nThe writers of this article are students at State College Area High School.\nThis article originally appeared in the Centre Daily Times."

    "text": "SHEFFIELD, Pa. — Bill Eckert slipped into his hip waders and splashed through the small stream near his cabin in the Allegheny National Forest.\nHe didn’t bring his fishing pole this time. Instead, Eckert bent down and let the cold water fill the assorted bottles he carried.\nEckert was among a few dozen volunteers collecting water samples that could help researchers develop a clearer picture of water quality in Pennsylvania.\n“If you enjoy the outdoors, you’re sort of concerned about preserving it, making sure the streams are clean,” Eckert said on a cool October morning.\nThe effort was part of Snapshot Day, a recurring event organized by Penn State researchers and Trout Unlimited to get volunteers out to sample streams in different parts of the state.\nBack at Penn State, researchers test the water samples for things like methane concentration, which can be an indicator of contamination from Marcellus Shale gas extraction or old, forgotten conventional oil and gas wells.\n“We started this project initially to monitor streams around Pennsylvania using volunteers to help look at methane in stream water,” said Joshua Woda, a graduate student in the Department of Geosciences who is involved in the project.\nThe tests can help fingerprint the methane’s source, weeding out natural causes often found in streams from things like swamps or bogs.\nIf scientists find elevated methane levels, they can identify the area as a hot spot and put more resources into investigating what is happening there.\n“We look for these elevated values, and when we see them over a certain threshold, we start to ask questions,” Woda said. “Why is this elevated?”\nThe work is part of a larger effort to help better our understanding of baseline water quality across the state. The data could be an important measuring stick if we someday face future water quality issues.\nBut gathering the information is no small task. There are hundreds of streams in Pennsylvania and only so many researchers working on the project.   \n“By volunteering to collect water samples around their communities, citizen scientists can play an important role in helping researchers better understand water quality in Pennsylvania,” said Susan Brantley, professor of geosciences and director of the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute at Penn State, and Woda’s adviser. “These samples help paint a clearer picture of baseline water quality around our communities, and can be used to watch for potential future environmental impacts.”\nIn the Allegheny National Forest, researchers were interested in the possible impacts of so-called orphaned and abandoned oil or gas wells. Some of these wells date back more than a hundred years, and if they aren’t properly plugged, or if they have been damaged over time, they could potentially allow contaminants to enter the atmosphere or waterways. Estimates put the number of unlocated wells as high as 500,000.\nOn Snapshot Day, volunteers fanned out across the forest in groups, visiting small headwater streams, so numerous that they sometimes receive less monitoring than the larger streams and rivers they feed.\n“There are just so many of them that agencies don’t have the capacity to comprehensively monitor them,” said Jacob Lemon, a science coordinator with Trout Unlimited. “That’s why it’s really important to get volunteers in there. You can get local boots on the ground. These people are the ones that spend time out there. They know what the streams are like and what they should be like.”\nThe event is a way to get more Trout Unlimited members involved with ongoing water quality monitoring projects the group regularly undertakes. \nFor Eckert, who was attending his first Snapshot Day, any time spent among the trees and streams in the forest is good. Helping monitor water quality is an added bonus. “We’re not wasting time,” he said."

    "text": "STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — A diverse group — from natural gas industry representatives to environmental advocates — gathered recently to discuss the impact of gas drilling on waterways at the 2015 Shale Network Workshop.\nThe annual workshop gives scientists a chance to share what they’ve learned over the last year about the impact of Marcellus shale gas drilling on the region’s streams and rivers, and to plan the best way to monitor water quality going forward.\nThe workshop also brings together groups that might not otherwise sit down to share concerns, observations and data – including citizen scientists, faculty, researchers and representatives from industry, government agencies and nonprofits.\n“It is important to have these groups together because it is so rare for industry personnel, watershed groups, government agency workers and academics to interact informally and while discussing science – in a non-combative atmosphere,” said Susan Brantley, distinguished professor of geosciences and director of the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute (EESI) at Penn State.\n“By promoting excellent science in a venue where researchers talk to non-researchers, an atmosphere is created that allows real conversation,” Brantley said. “One of the reasons that Shale Network can do this is that it has been funded by the National Science Foundation and by Penn State, both of which are honest brokers in the shale gas debates.”\nThe NSF-funded Shale Network is a collaborative effort to collect and analyze data on water quality in the Marcellus shale region. Its members include faculty and researchers from Penn State, the University of Pittsburgh, Dickinson College and the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science Inc. (CUAHSI).\nIn its fourth year, the conference drew about 80 participants, including representatives from Chesapeake Energy, the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, the Washington County Watershed Alliance, the US Geological Survey, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and NSF.\nShale Network hosted the event through EESI at the Atherton Hotel in State College. Participants focused on what they have learned so far about the impact of natural gas drilling on water quality and where future efforts should be directed.\n“This year we further discussed both the fact the only a very few significant problems have been identified in water quality data in Pennsylvania that can be attributed to shale gas activities, but that some of these problems must nonetheless be better understood,” Brantley said. “One area of growing interest is the idea that we might want to monitor methane dissolved in streams as a way to look for leakage of gas into aquifers.”\nAt the conference, Brantley discussed enlisting citizen scientists to help gather baseline information on area waterways using a new stream-based monitoring technique that can detect methane levels. Baseline information helps researchers detect future changes in water quality.\nThe data is important as some have raised concerns that hydraulic fracturing or fracking, the process used to extract gas or oil from shale deep beneath the ground, could lead to potential pollution of waterways because of spills or improperly sealed sites.\nShale Network has already collected a large database from water samples from the region. Software designed by CUAHSI and made publically available lets researchers track data to detect possible changes in water quality.\nFunded by a four-year grant from the NSF, the Shale Network is in its final year. Researchers are looking at options for continuing the project. Data will continue to be available through CUASHI."

    "text": "UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — A new study of groundwater in a rural Pennsylvania county shows only rare instances of possible gas contamination amid an overall trend of improving water quality despite heavy Marcellus Shale development.\nBy investigating data from gas companies, the state, and the U.S. Geological Survey, researchers saw possible contamination by natural gas near no more than seven out of 1,385 shale wells studied in heavily drilled Bradford County. The rest of the water chemistry data highlighted that groundwater had either improved or remained level from samples taken prior to the 1990s.\n“The most interesting thing we discovered was the groundwater chemistry in one of the areas most heavily developed for shale gas – an area with 1400 new gas wells – does not appear to be getting worse with time, and may even be getting better,” said Susan Brantley, director of Penn State’s Earth and Environmental Systems Institute and distinguished professor of geosciences. “But using data analytics we could also see rare sites that warrant more investigation for possible gas anomalies.”\nBrantley and an interdisciplinary team of geoscientists and computer scientists used new data-mining techniques to study a large dataset of 11,000 groundwater samples from the 2010s, taken after drilling in Bradford County.\nThe team recently reported their findings in the journal Environmental Science & Technology.\n“Unlike previous studies, our findings show that groundwater quality might even be improving in an area heavily exploited for shale gas — northeastern Bradford,” said Tao Wen, a post-doctoral scholar in Penn State’s Earth and Environmental Systems Institute and lead author on the paper.\nFind more details on the PSU News"

    "text": "Introduction to the Shale Network database: encouraging data sharing and interaction and study around Marcellus water quality issues\nTo coordinate the collection of data for water quality and quantity in regions of hydrofracturing, a workshop was convened at the Pennsylvania State University in State College, Pennsylvania. The purpose of the workshop held on April 23-24 2012 was to encourage participants to begin to use and contribute data to our growing database of water quality and quantity for regions of shale gas development.\nForty-one participants – all of whom work on water issues related to shale gas – attended the workshop run by researchers from Penn State, Pitt, Dickinson College, and the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences, Inc. (CUAHSI). This team has been funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) since October 2011 to create the Shale Network database to organize information about water quality and quantity in regions centered around the Marcellus. The intent is to promote understanding of the possible impacts of gas development on water through development of our online database. The Shale Network team is testing whether the inclusion of data from groups of citizen scientists can promote new discoveries and facilitate public education with respect to environmental issues. The database currently contains data from academic scientists, industry, community watershed groups, and government agencies and includes analyses of 60 different constituents for some samples. Metadata is included to describe characteristics of the data, including its quality assurance level. Furthermore, it is the philosophy of the Shale Network team that the best insurance of data quality is to share data online for all researchers to test and compare.\nOf the 41 workshop attendees, 23 were from universities, 6 from government agencies, 2 from environmental consulting firms, 3 from county district offices, and 7 from non-profit organizations. All participants were introduced to the Shale Network database through HydroDesktop, a publicly available web service maintained by CUAHSI. By placing the ShaleNetwork database online at a CUAHSI Hydroserver, the data can be accessed along with data from the United States Geologic Survey, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other groups hosting data on Hydroservers around the country. Currently, the Shale Network team has uploaded data for surface waters, groundwaters, waste effluent, flowback and production waters. Those interested in contributing more data are encouraged to register with the Shale Network.\nWorkshop participants reached eight conclusions. First, we discovered that extensive water data is available in areas of shale gas – but data collation is needed. Second, participants agreed that the Shale Network team should partner with state agencies and industry to move their datasets online. Third, participants discovered that it is already possible to use the database to assess data gaps with respect to location or parameters. Fourth, the team was encouraged to search out data and prioritize uploads to plug gaps. Fifth, while ongoing efforts to find and upload data will be continuing at least for the three years of NSF funding, the database could be sustained by others long-term if the Shale Network team simplifies the process of uploading data and finds ways to create community buy-in or incentives for data uploads. Sixth, while more metadata can always be added, the database itself and the workshops for the database (to be held in 2013, 2014) should also drive future agreement about analytical protocols that could simplify metadata in the future. Seventh, the database itself is already encouraging other groups to upload data to Hydroservers: the Shale Network team is partnering with such groups. Finally, a user interface is needed that is easier and more accessible for citizens to understand the data.\nWorkshop Materials\n\nOpening presentation\nSurface water impacts presentation\nWorkshop agenda\n\n2012 Shale Network Workshop Attendees\nAcademic\n\nThomas Barnard, Wilkes University\nLaura Branby, Allegheny College\nKirk Jalbert, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute\nWendy Kedzierski, Allegheny College\nAbby J.

    "text": "Founding Team\nPenn State Team\nThe Penn State team is leading the effort for database development for waters from the central and eastern parts of PA and the Devonian shale gas region. The team will work closely with a professor at Lock Haven University, M. Khalequzzaman, who is already sampling rivers in central PA near Lock Haven.\nThe Director of the Shale Network is Susan Brantley, an aqueous geochemist and Director of Penn State’s Earth and Environmental Systems Institute (EESI). Brantley has more than 25 years of research experience and 10 years experience in administration of research and education teams. Brantley is responsible for coordinating and supervising all activities of the Shale Network, including the running of the annual workshops, and supervision of all Penn State personnel working on the ShaleNetwork. In this endeavor she is aided by EESI staff assistant Shelly Farrell and science writer Matt Carroll. Ferrell is the main staff coordinator for the annual workshop. Data specialists are working with Brantley to input data into the database.\nDavid Yoxtheimer, an outreach specialist for the Penn State Marcellus Center for Outreach and Research (a center within EESI) and a PSU-trained hydrogeologist, is helping to identify and communicate with water sampling groups throughout the state. Yoxtheimer participates as part of his job in the Marcellus Center for Outreach and Education in more than 200 outreach activities per year working with PA citizens to understand Marcellus impacts.\nIn addition, Yoxtheimer works closely with the Marcellus Shale Coalition (MSC), an organization committed to the responsible development of natural gas from the Marcellus Shale geological formation and the enhancement of the region’s economy related to this energy source. The members of the coalition, which include most of the energy companies developing shale gas in both Pennsylvania and surrounding states, work with partners across the region to address issues with regulators, local, county, state and federal government officials and communities about all aspects of natural gas from the Marcellus Shale. This contact is keeping communication open with industry stakeholders and will facilitate possible future use of proprietary industry data. Conversations about proprietary data sources are already ongoing.\nDr. Greg O’Toole is a faculty member and Web technology expert at Penn State (IST, EESI), and is the ShaleNetwork HCI engineer for online networking and environmental data-sharing web applications. Greg is a Lecturer in the College of Information Science & Technology at Penn State. Greg runs the scientific content management system czen.org, a clearinghouse for research and researchers on soils and water, and he is building and managing the scientific content management system for the ShaleNetwork (shalenetwork.org).\nJennifer Williams, Penn State researcher, works in data organization for Shale Network and also works to lead the Teen Shale Network. Teen Shale Network is an effort to help teenagers from State College Area High school and a few other high schools in the northeast to sample and analyze water quality data in the area of shale gas development.\nPitt Team\nPitt is facilitating identification and communication with water sampling groups in the western part of PA and the Devonian shale gas region and will host one of the annual ShaleNetwork meetings. Specific questions of interest to the Pitt team have included the following:\nHow do the flow hydrodynamics modulate the mixing processes of contaminants throughout the streams and are they important for developing appropriate protocols for water chemistry sampling? Are the above protocols similar for small streams (e.g. Fonner Run and Bates Fork) and large river systems (e.g. Monongahela River)? What are temporal and spatial scales for the mixing processes for different contaminant species? What relationships can be observed between hydrogeochemical and hydrological observations and locations of Marcellus shale extraction points as well as population density or land use characteristics?\nShaleNetwork Steering Committee member, Radisav Vidic (Environmental Engineering program in Pitt CEE with specialties in water quality, pollutant transformation, transport and water treatment), has worked since 2007 on Marcellus water quality problems. Vidic works closely with the entire ShaleNetwork team in all aspects of management of the ShaleNetwork.\nCUAHSI Team\nConsortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences, Inc. (CUAHSI), an NSF-funded organization of academic hydrologists, is responsible for all technical aspects of the water database development and coordination with the CUAHSI-developed Hydrologic Information System. CUAHSI is providing training for ShaleNetwork personnel. CUAHSI is hosting a Hydroserver for the ShaleNetwork database. In addition, CUAHSI is assisting to adapt the HydroDesktop client for use by the ShaleNetwork team, shale gas play scientists, and citizen scientists. CUAHSI will also be providing training at the annual meetings on data access and analysis. CUAHSI will also be providing training at the annual meetings on data access and analysis.

    "text": "Quality Assurance and Quality Control\nWe accept project data from associations, groups, or agencies in all formats. Data that will be input into the Shale Network database will generally be stored first as Excel files. We assemble these files for data entry into the CUAHSI Hydrologic Information System (HIS) for permanent publication online and for access through HydroClient and HydroShare.\nThe Shale Network database team will accept data and organize it and place it online so that citizens and researchers can understand whether development of shale gas is affecting water quality and quantity. The data are housed in a permanent database that is funded for permanent access online by the National Science Foundation. Data in Shale Network can be accessed along with all other data published online, including data from EPA, USGS, and academic researchers. Assessment of the quality of data is very difficult, regardless of whether data is collected by scientists or volunteers. Our overall philosophy will be to accept data and place it online for the community of citizens and researchers to evaluate, as long as the data provider has some level of quality assurance and control. Levels of data quality will be indicated within the database as a metadata field. All data in the database will not have the same data quality. However, finding data will be much easier: the researcher can then spend resources assessing data quality rather than finding data.\nQuality assurance refers to measures taken to ensure data meets data quality standards; quality control means the actions implemented to achieve quality. Data quality objectives include that the data must be credible and of sufficient value for timely response to problems. We accept data from volunteers who have received training from service providers in the state of PA such as ALLARM. This training generally consists of close examination of the monitoring manuals, laboratory training on equipment, and field training including chemical monitoring, flow measurement, and visual assessment. Meters for measurement of conductivity are calibrated with standard solutions before each use and are stored according to manufacturer specifications between use. Volunteers generally work with ALLARM to pass a split sample quality control test annually. Specifically, monitors generally use meters to test waters and then collect an extra set of water samples to send to the ALLARM lab. At the lab, the water is tested using the monitors’ equipment as well as laboratory equipment and results are compared to volunteer data. If precision is acceptable, volunteers have passed quality control and can continue monitoring to provide data. If precision is not acceptable (outside limits), ALLARM re-trains volunteers. All methods are documented. ALLARM is responsible for QC/QA with volunteer groups as appropriate. Some ALLARM groups collect samples and send them to commercial laboratories as well.",

Hydrodesktop accesses many databases other than the ShaleNetwork, and many of these databases will also have utility for understanding water quality and quantity issues with respect to the Devonian shale gas plays. The ShaleNetwork team is working with other entities such as the Susquehanna River Basin Commission to help provide their data appropriately, either within the ShaleNetwork database or at least accessible by HydroDesktop.\nThe database standard used by the Shale Network database is evoling from the Observations Data Model (ODM) (Horsburgh et al., 2008) to ODM2.

    "text": "Publishing and Accessing Data with CUAHSI HIS\nThe CUAHSI HIS (Hydrologic Information System) is designed to manage and to publish data collected at fixed points, such as wells and surface water sampling stations. We are using this service because we have data from various sources that we want to make accessible online – this is called publishing the data – in a standard way so that everyone can access and use it. CUAHSI hosts a HydroServer and uses it to host the Shale Network database. CUAHSI already interacts heavily with the USGS, and USGS data are already a part of the CUAHSI HIS, or can be “ingested” easily. CUAHSI has also worked with EPA so that EPA data are available using HydroClient, and has worked with several state agencies around the country to format the state data into the HIS. Agencies that are interested in having their data available in HydroClient are encouraged to contact CUAHSI directly or discuss the issue with members of Shale Network.\nA Hydroserver is essentially a Windows XP computer running HIS software designed for data publication. Because it does not require a commercial license we are using HydroServer Lite. HydroLite uses the Observations Data Model for data storage and a WaterOneFlow web service for data publication.\nFor some datasets that we are given from data providers, we use the application ODM Data Loader (ODMDL) to load data files into an ODM database. This method is appropriate for data that are the result of a project or study that has been completed and will not need periodic updating. For data that are being continuously updated (i.e., data streaming from sensors in the field) we use the ODM Streaming Data Loader (also free software). The concept behind ODMDL is that it accepts input data in table format (Excel, CSV, or tab- separated), and it is designed to enable the loading of data into ODM tables either one at a time or as bulk data loading from a single file into multiple tables all at once. Once data are loaded into an ODM database, we can look at the data using the application ODM Tools. ODM Tools provide query and visualization capabilities. If the data look good, we can then publish the data with a WaterOne Flow web service. This service essentially hooks directly into an ODM database to publish data from that database. When data are published this way, it results in a standard output format called WaterML.\nThe next step after publishing is to register our WaterOneFlow web service. Registering is necessary in order for people to access our data (data discovery). To do this, HIS Central is a website maintained by the CUAHSI HIS team where we register our WaterOneFlow web service. Our service will then be discoverable along with dozens of other web services registered with the system (including services for the USGS NWIS and the EPA STORET datasets). HIS Central is the largest single catalog of the nation’s water data. HIS Central includes the free and open source desktop application, Hydrodesktop. Hydrodesktop allows users to search for data across all registered data sources at once.",

The first is a tour of the Eureka Resources Williamsport, Pa. facility, an oil and gas wastewater management plant. This facility is designed for the pretreatment, recycling and disposal of wastewater from natural gas drilling and production operations in the Marcellus and Utica Shales. The second is a tour of the Wayne Township Landfill in Clinton County, Pa. The landfill manages drilling cuttings and muds generated primarily from shale well drilling operations and uses some novel practices to minimize the industry’s environmental footprint. In addition, the facility hosts a compressed natural gas filling station for vehicles, including trash hauling vehicles. The tentative field trip schedule is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n9:30 a.m.\n\n\n\n\nMeet in Nittany Lion Inn lobby\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9:45 a.m.\n\n\n\n\nDepart for Williamsport\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.\n\n\n\n\nTour Eureka Resources gas well wastewater treatment facility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12:00 p.m. - 1:00 p.m.\n\n\n\n\nBring your own lunch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1:00 p.m.\n\n\n\n\nDepart for Wayne Township\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1:30 - 3:30 p.m.\n\n\n\n\nTour Wayne Township Landfill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4:30 p.m.\n\n\n\n\nReturn to Nittany Lion Inn\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Shale Network is a collaborative effort between Penn State, the University of Pittsburgh and the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences Inc. (CUAHSI) to collect and analyze data on water quality in the Marcellus Shale drilling region.

    "text": "UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — A computer program is diving deep into water quality data from Pennsylvania, helping scientists detect potential environmental impacts of Marcellus Shale gas drilling.\nThe work, supported by a new $1 million grant from the National Science Foundation, pairs a cross-disciplinary team of Penn State computer scientists and geoscientists studying methane concentrations in the state’s streams, rivers and private water wells.\n“We want to take a data-driven approach to assess the impact of shale gas development,” said Zhenhui “Jessie” Li, assistant professor of information sciences and technology, Penn State, and co-principal investigator on the project. “We are using data-mining techniques and learning computer models to look at how methane concentration correlates with other factors, like distance from unconventional shale gas wells and geological features such as faults.”\nMethane occurs naturally in waterways, but may also be released by unconventional drilling, or fracking, associated with natural gas development. While environmental impacts from shale drilling appear to be rare compared to the number of drilled wells, the testing will give scientists a better idea of how and why they do occur.\nPenn State geoscientists have studied methane concentrations around shale gas drilling for years and have collected large datasets from samples taken by researchers, environmental groups and government agencies. However, sifting through big data is labor intensive, and complex patterns that might reveal potential problems can be difficult for humans to spot.\n“It’s always been frustrating to me because we get these water datasets that are sort of here, there and everywhere, and you can’t put them together into a scientific explanation,” said Susan Brantley, distinguished professor of geosciences and director of the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute, Penn State, and principal investigator on the project. “It’s like a jigsaw puzzle with a lot of pieces missing. The story is still there, but you can’t see it as a human being. I think it’s possible the computer techniques that Jessie has can help us pull that story out and fill in some of the missing pieces.”\nFor more information on this project, visit PSU News"

    "text": "UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — It’s been a decade since the start of the Marcellus Shale gas boom in Pennsylvania, and today more than 10,000 unconventional gas wells dot the state’s hills and valleys.\nThe industry’s rapid development created economic opportunities for many, but also brought environmental concerns, and sometimes led to contentious conversations.\nA team of researchers studying water quality around hydraulic fracturing, the process used to extract gas from rock deep underground, have found a blueprint to move those conversations forward.\nShale Network has for the past six years fostered a dialogue about shale drilling between concerned citizens, watershed groups, government regulators and personnel from large energy companies by focusing on publicly available water quality data.\nAn annual workshop hosted at the University Park campus gives people a chance to come together, learn about the latest water quality research and data, and talk about ways to move forward together.\n“I don’t believe that anyone else was able to bring such a diverse group of people together to discuss this extremely complex problem from their unique perspectives but with a common goal to jointly advance the understanding of this problem and rationally discuss possible ways forward,” said Radisav Vidic, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of Pittsburgh and Shale Network member.\nA shared interest in gathering, discussing and improving water quality data among diverse groups can lead to productive conversations that data alone cannot address, the scientists reported in an article published in the journal Science.\n“We’ve been trying to figure out how to pull people together and look at numbers to understand impacts,” said Susan Brantley, distinguished professor of geosciences and director of the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute at Penn State. “That can lead to better decisions.\n“That’s really what Shale Network is all about,” said Brantley, who is lead investigator of the group. “We want to help everyone understand what the numbers — in this case water chemistry numbers — mean related to shale gas development.”\nFor the past six years, Shale Network researchers have collected and published water quality data online. Their database contains more than a million pieces of data from 28,000 locations across the state, some never available before. The Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science (CUAHSI) hosts the public database with funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF).\n“We have all these data points that are starting to be at our fingertips, and we have computational tools to work with the data,” Brantley said. “Yet, the numbers don’t mean anything unless you are working together. Not just with geologists or geochemists, but people who live in the area the data comes from. You need that collaboration to understand what the numbers mean. Local community members teach us about their landscapes and their needs.”\nBrantley said people know what is happening in their backyards. Watershed groups near Pittsburgh, for instance, know to look out for discharge from old coal mines, which wouldn’t be a factor in other parts of the state.\nThe database has proven useful, but even more important has been the process of building it, the researchers said in the paper. Collaborations between diverse stakeholders have helped forge a social network with diverse perspectives and concerns.\n“We may have developed a blueprint for how to engage different stakeholders and develop a commonality of purpose even in something as controversial and complicated as unconventional gas extraction,” Vidic said. “Perhaps this blueprint can be applied for the same problem elsewhere in the world or for other complex problems.”\nShale Network researchers act as honest brokers in discussions like those that take place at the group’s annual workshops.\n“We are not trying to prove fracking is bad,” Brantley said. “We are not trying to prove water quality is perfect. We are trying to look at what the water chemistry looks like in the areas where fracking is occurring and help all kinds of people talk about that together.”\nCo-authors include Kathryn Brasier, associate professor of rural sociology, Dave Yoxtheimer, EESI research assistant, and Tao Wen, a post-doctoral scholar, all at Penn State; and Candie Wilderman, professor at Dickinson College.\nFounded in 2010 with NSF funding, the Shale Network is a collaborative effort between Penn State, the University of Pittsburgh, Dickinson College and CUAHSI to collect and analyze data on water quality in the Marcellus Shale drilling region.\nPlease read details on the PSU News"

    "text": "Substances commonly used for drilling or extracting Marcellus shale gas foamed from the drinking water taps of three Pennsylvania homes near a reported well-pad leak, according an analysis from a team of scientists.\nThe researchers used a new analytical technique on samples from the homes and found a chemical compound, 2-BE, and an unidentified complex mixture of organic contaminants, both commonly seen in flowback water from Marcellus shale activity. The scientists recently published their findings in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n“These findings are important because we show that chemicals traveled from shale gas wells more than two kilometers in the subsurface to drinking water wells,” said co-author Susan Brantley, distinguished professor of geosciences and director of the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute at Penn State. “The chemical that we identified either came from fracking fluids or from drilling additives and it moved with natural gas through natural fractures in the rock. In addition, for the first time, all of the data are released so that anyone can study the problem.”\nSuch contamination from shale gas wells in shallow potable water sources has never been fully documented before, Brantley said. The new technique  could be a valuable tool in evaluating alleged causes of unconventional gas drilling impacts to groundwater.\n“More studies, such as ours, need to be disseminated to the general public to promote transparency and to help guide environmental policies for improving unconventional gas development,” said Garth Llewellyn, principal hydrogeologist at Appalachia Hydrogeologic and Environmental Consulting and the paper’s lead author.\nThe affected homes are located near a reported pit leak at a Marcellus shale gas well pad. Scientists believe stray natural gas and wastewater were driven one to three kilometers (0.6 to 1.8 miles) laterally along shallow to intermediate depth fractures to the source of the homes’ well water.\nState environmental regulators previously found high levels of natural gas in the water, but did not discover flowback water contamination above regulatory limits and could not determine what was making the water foam, according to the researchers.\nThe team used highly sophisticated equipment and tested for a range of possible contaminants at low concentration levels, rather than testing for specific substances.\n“This work demonstrates that these events are possible, but that more sophisticated analytical work may be necessary to uncover the details of the impact,” said co-author Frank Dorman, associate professor of biochemistry and molecular biology, Penn State. “In short, we were able to confirm water contamination because we are using non-conventional techniques. Specifically, GCxGC-TOFMS allowed for the characterization of this drinking water where routine testing was not able to determine what was causing the foaming.” GC-GC-TOFMS is a form of gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry.\nThe homes were sold to the gas company as part of a legal settlement in 2012, but scientists received samples before the transfer.\nThe research was supported by funding from the National Science Foundation.\nTo see the journal article, click here or visit the Resources tab of the Shale Network website. \nSeveral of the article’s authors have answered some frequently asked questions, and that can be viewed by clicking here and downloading the PDF."
