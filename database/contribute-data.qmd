We are actively inputting data into the Shale Network database. We have input published data, new data, online data, and unpublished data. Shale Network is interested in data providers and volunteers that can collect their own water data and add this data to the Shale Network dataset. We seek datasets from community groups, researchers, government agencies, industry, and river commissions. If you would like to submit a database or begin working with us, please fill out the quick data volunteer form.
