    "section": "Grading",
    "text": "Grading\n\nYour grade will be based on:\n\nProblem Sets (20%): four problem sets worth an average 5% each\nLab Reports (30%): six lab reports worth 5% each\nProject Report (15%): A final paper due during finals week\nMidterm Exam (15%)\nFinal Exam (20%)\n\nLate assignments will have 5% deducted from the final grade for each day that they are late and will not be accepted after graded assignments have been returned.\nStudents are encouraged to work with and talk with each other about assignments, but all work handed in by each student must represent that student’s own contribution. The instructor will follow all aspects of the university’s policies for academic integrity.\n[Optional for the Fall 2024 semester] Field and Laboratory experience: This class will take a mandatory field trip to collect water samples (further discussed below). Students will prepare the water samples for chemical analysis during class hours or outside of class hours as needed.\nGrading-related questions: I recognize that you care about the score you receive in this class. However, there may be times where I may enter a wrong score in a grade book, or when you may wish to know more about why you received a certain grade. For grading related questions, I am using a 24-7 rule:\n\nImmediately after new grades are added, you must wait 24 hours before contacting me about your grade. This waiting period helps with hasty reactions. I will not respond to any request made during this period.\nThe deadline for appealing a grade is seven days after the grade is released in Blackboard. Please be sure to include any specifics in your email to me about your grade.\n\nLetter Grades\n\n\n\n\nLetter Grade\nMinimum Percentage\n\n\n\n\nA\n93%\n\n\nA-\n90%\n\n\nB+\n87%\n\n\nB\n83%\n\n\nB-\n80%\n\n\nC+\n77%\n\n\nC\n73%\n\n\nC-\n70%\n\n\nD\n60%\n\n\nF\n59% and below\n\n\n\n\n(Optional for the Fall 2024 semester) Field Trip\nA mandatory field trip will take place in the week of October 6. Students will travel to the Meadowbrook Creek in the City of Syracuse to collect water samples and conduct chemical analyses. Results obtained from these samples will serve as the basis for the final report described below. The date and plan of the field trip will be discussed on the first day of class.\n\n\nProblem Sets\nProblem sets will require you to use concepts learned in class to calculate geochemical parameters. The purpose of the problem sets is to assess the development of your quantitative skills. Notes on problem sets:\n\nShow your work! Ample credit will be given for developing a logical strategy and listing data and equations you would use to solve the problem. Points will be lost if no work is shown.\nKeep your work organized and legible to allow for proper grading. Follow rules for significant figures. Circle your final answer.\nWhile students are encouraged to discuss their results and problem-solving strategies, all work turned in must be your own. No two problem sets should have identical worked-out solutions.\n\n\n\nLab Reports\nLab exercises will be conducted approximately weekly to bi-weekly to supplement lecture material. The purpose of the lab reports is to develop analytical, communication, and critical thinking skills. Students must wear closed toed shoes and pants to enter the chemistry laboratory. Note that some labs will consist of paper discussions or classroom exercise with computers rather than hands-on exercises. For paper discussions, students must come to class prepared to discuss the assigned paper. Responses to paper discussions will be completed prior to class and turned in at the end of the class period on the day that the paper is discussed.\n\n\nProject Report\nThe project report is an extended laboratory report that investigates the topic as chosen by the student. Technical reports are a staple of most jobs; thus, the purpose of this assignment is to prepare students to clearly and effectively communicate scientific results. Prior to the final project report due, students will need to turn in their project idea and a one-pager of their project report in weeks 5 and 10, respectively. These will be commented, and students will be expected to incorporate comments into the final version. The final project report will be due at the end of the semester and will include introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections. Class time will be devoted to discussion of results, and students are encouraged to discuss the project outside of class to formulate hypotheses and conclusions.\n\n\nExams\nTwo exams will be given during the semester in order to evaluate each student’s ability to synthesize and apply course concepts. The exams will include a mix of calculations and short answers derived from material covered in lectures and laboratory exercises.",

They are for the sole use of students currently enrolled in this class and may be subject to copyright. If you take materials provided for this class electronically and then post them to the web in return for monetary compensation, you may be violating copyright, particularly if you include images and PowerPoint slides provided by the professor.\n\n\nStudents in Need of Disability-Related Academic Accommodations\nSyracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. There may be aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course. I invite any student to contact me to discuss strategies and/or accommodations (academic adjustments) that may be essential to your success and to collaborate with the Center for Disability Resources (CDR) in this process. If you would like to discuss disability-accommodations or register with CDR, please visit Center for Disability Resources. Please call (315) 443-4498 or email disabilityresources@syr.edu for more detailed information. The CDR is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic accommodations and will work with the student to develop an access plan. Academic accommodations, such as exam administration, are not provided retroactively; therefore, planning for accommodations as early as possible is necessary.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nSyracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy reflects the high value that we, as a university community, place on honesty in academic work. The policy defines our expectations for academic honesty and holds students accountable for the integrity of all work they submit. Students should understand that it is their responsibility to learn about course-specific expectations, as well as about university-wide academic integrity expectations. The policy governs appropriate citation and use of sources, the integrity of work submitted in exams and assignments, and the veracity of signatures on attendance sheets and other verification of participation in class activities. The policy also prohibits students from submitting the same work in more than one class without receiving written authorization in advance from both instructors. Under the policy, students found in violation are subject to grade sanctions determined by the course instructor and non-grade sanctions determined by the School or College where the course is offered as described in the Violation and Sanction Classification Rubric. Syracuse University students are required to read an online summary of the University’s academic integrity expectations and provide an electronic signature agreeing to abide by them twice a year during pre-term check- in on MySlice.\nThe Violation and Sanction Classification Rubric establishes recommended guidelines for the determination of grade penalties by faculty and instructors, while also giving them discretion to select the grade penalty they believe most suitable, including course failure, regardless of violation level. Any established violation in this course may result in course failure regardless of violation level.\nAll academic integrity expectations that apply to in-person quizzes and exams also apply to online quizzes and exams. In this course, all work submitted for quizzes and exams must be yours alone. Discussing quiz or exam questions with anyone during the quiz or exam period violates academic integrity expectations for this course. Using websites that charge fees or require uploading of course material (e.g., Chegg, Course Hero) to obtain exam solutions or assignments completed by others and present the work as your own violates academic integrity expectations in this course.\n\n\nFaith Tradition Observances\nSU’s religious observances policy, found at SU website, recognizes the diversity of faiths represented in the campus community and protects the rights of students, faculty, and staff to observe religious holy days according to their tradition. Syracuse University does not set aside non-instructional days for any religious holiday. Students must notify instructors by the end of the second week of classes when they will be observing their religious holiday(s). Students will have access to an online notification form through MySlice for two weeks beginning on the first day of class. Once I have been notified of your intention to be absent for a religious observance, I will work with you directly to find a way to accommodate your absence.\n\n\nClass Absences and Associated Missed Work\nExcuses for class absences for medical reasons will be given only if such absences are advised by a health care provider at the Health Center, based on clinical findings and prescribed treatment recommendations. Excused notes will not be given solely to confirm a visit to the Health Center. For complete details on excuse notes, visit this [SU website].\n\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\nSyracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. There may be aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course. I invite any student to contact me to discuss strategies and/or accommodations (academic adjustments) that may be essential to your success and to collaborate with the Center for Disability Resources (CDR) in this process.\nIf you would like to discuss disability-accommodations or register with CDR, please visit Center for Disability Resources. Please call (315) 443-4498 or email disabilityresources@syr.edu for more detailed information.\nThe CDR is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic accommodations and will work with the student to develop an access plan.

    "text": "Hi there! I’m Tao Wen (pronounced as “Tau When”). I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Syracuse University. My primary research interests involve studying water and elemental cycles within coupled human and natural systems across varying temporal and spatial scales using both data science (big data) and case study (small data) approaches. Since joining the faculty in 2020, I have designed, built, and directed the Syracuse University Hydrogeochemistry And eNvironmental Data Sciences (HANDS) and Noble Gases in Earth Systems Tracing (NEST) Research Laboratories. In the WEN research group, we analyze water quality parameters and the isotopic compositions of selected elements (e.g., oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen) and noble gases (i.e., He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) using ion chromatography, optical emission spectrometry, water isotope analyzers, and mass spectrometry. Additionally, we develop and utilize emerging machine learning and geostatistical tools to assess the interplay between water and elemental cycles in Earth-surface systems, as well as investigate how these cycles are regulated by human activities (e.g., energy extraction, urbanization) and natural processes. I teach a variety of water-related and data science-related courses at Syracuse University for both undergraduate and graduate students, including Introduction to Earth and Environmental Data Analysis (EAR 201), Water and Our Environment (EAR 205), Hydrogeology (EAR 401/601), Environmental Aqueous Geochemistry (EAR 419/619), and Machine Learning in Earth and Environmental Sciences (EAR 400/600). Many of the teaching materials and other online learning modules I have developed are publicly accessible on the Education page, as I strongly believe in open science and open education."

The accommodations are newly constructed and comprise of 22,000 square feet, including core laboratories and individual faculty laboratories. The core laboratories include a microbiology, soil, 3 analytical, water, acid wash, trace metals and state of the art Class 10,000 clean room. In addition, there is a radioactive isotope laboratory, dark room, 3 constant temperature rooms, cold room, computer lab for students equipped with personal computers and printers, and a teaching laboratory. The facilities have been designed with versatility required for interdisciplinary research.\nAnalytical and Technical Services (A&TS) at SUNY ESF: A&TS has developed an extensive portfolio of chemical analysis methods and capabilities in computer and instrument repair, electronic design and chemical stockroom services to complement the academic activities of the ESF community. Provided services include nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GS/MS), liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), instrument and equipment repair and fabrication, inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), chemical and laboratory apparatus stockroom, and polymer rheology and mechanical properties.\n\n\n\n\nResearch Computing Resources\n\nMultiple high performance workstations for the WEN group use only\nData Centers: Syracuse University host a state-of-the-art data center, including 6,000 square feet of floor space and 450 kilowatts of power and cooling. It is now the main center for production computing resources, marrying research and administrative computing interests. The internal data center network is a mix of 10 and 40 Gigabit connectivity, with redundant connections to all hosts and network components whenever possible. The data center supports a robust virtual private cloud where 98% of campus servers have been consolidated. The data center is connected to the campus network and secondary data center via two bundles of geographically diverse, 144 strand fiber paths. This can be and has been used to provide direct connectivity between a researcher’s campus building and the hosted area in the primary data center.\nAcademic Virtual Hosting Environment (AVHE): The Academic Virtual Hosting Environment (AVHE) provides a virtual computing cloud to the Syracuse University research community, lowering the bar of entry for small to medium sized research efforts. The AVHE platform provides two Petabytes of storage, 1000 cores, and 25TB of memory for research use. The AVHE uses virtualization to provide flexibility and hardware sharing to allow multiple researchers to operate on an underlying server and storage infrastructure.  This lower bar of entry and flexibility provides an environment that supports both traditional and non-traditional computational research.  The AVHE supports Windows and Linux operating systems with a dynamic resource allocation model for easy scaling and configuration. Beyond supporting individual workloads, another use case for the AVHE is building small to medium sized virtualized research computing clusters, reducing the need for researchers to build and maintain small physical clusters. The AVHE utilizes the abilities of virtualization to provide high availability, which automatically migrates workload to alternate resources in the case of physical server failure.  Backup services within the AVHE are a standard service provided to researchers.\nCrush: Crush is a medium scale virtualized research cloud. It is designed to be allocated for compute intensive work and to be used in tandem with the AVHE where the data and work scheduling infrastructure are maintained. A primary use case for Crush is the provisioning of a “cluster within a cluster” providing access to dedicated, customized compute nodes for high-performance and high-throughput computing. Nodes within Crush provide a diverse set of configurations including high density processing power, high speed disk I/O, and high-speed networking. Currently Crush consists of 25,000 cores and 150 Terabytes of memory."

Students will conduct experimental noble gas work in shallow and deep groundwater, natural gas, and/or rock samples.\nEnvironmental data sciences and geospatial modeling track: Students will work on a DOE-funded project to learn and apply machine learning and geospatial modeling to analyze multidisciplinary datasets to assess environmental impacts and greenhouse gas emission of oil and gas wells.\nGlobal elemental and water cycles track: Students will assess the elemental and water fluxes from the land water systems using machine learning, hydrological modeling, and/or Earth system modeling. Interested students should have a background in hydrogeology, geochemistry, or relevant fields and a motivation to learn programming.\nExternal Graduate Student Fellowships I am happy to work with interested candidates to collaboratively develop proposals for external graduate student fellowships, e.g., NSF GRFP."

This course is offered through the SERC platform, in partnership with CUAHSI HydroClient\nIn this course, learners will explore three aspects of oil and gas development-related production waters:\n\nwhy the waters cannot be discharged directly into rivers;\nhow disposal can be sometimes associated with earthquakes;\nhow Pennsylvania tries to find ways to dispose of brines safely. We use different online services to find publicly available data.\n\n\n\n\nThis image was created with the assistance of DALL·E"

    "text": "Grading\n\nYour grade will be based on:\n\nHomework (70%): Ten sets of homework worth an average 7% each\nClass attendance/participation (5%): Evaluated by in-class coding exercise\nFinal project (25%): A final paper due during finals week\nNo bonus or extra credits\n\nLate homework will have 10% deducted from the final grade for each day that they are late and will not be accepted after graded assignments have been returned.\nStudents are encouraged to work with and talk with each other about homework, but all work handed in by each student must represent that student’s own contribution. The instructor will follow all aspects of the university’s policies for academic integrity.\n*Grading-related questions: I recognize that you care about the score you receive in this class. However, there may be times where I may enter a wrong score in a grade book, or when you may wish to know more about why you received a certain grade. For grading related questions, I am using a 24-7 rule:\n\nImmediately after new grades are added, you must wait 24 hours before contacting me about your grade. This waiting period helps with hasty reactions. I will not respond to any request made during this period.\nThe deadline for appealing a grade is seven days after the grade is released in Blackboard. Please be sure to include any specifics in your email to me about your grade.\n\nLetter Grades\n\n\n\n\nLetter Grade\nMinimum Percentage\n\n\n\n\nA\n93%\n\n\nA-\n90%\n\n\nB+\n87%\n\n\nB\n83%\n\n\nB-\n80%\n\n\nC+\n77%\n\n\nC\n73%\n\n\nC-\n70%\n\n\nD\n60%\n\n\nF\n59% and below\n\n\n\n\nHomework\nAll homework, including code, datasets, and outputs, should be submitted through Blackboard Ultra. To receive credit for the homework, the submitted codes must be executable and runnable.\n\n\nFinal Project\nThis individual final project is designed to assess and apply the skills learned in this course. It is intended to be an assignment where you can choose a dataset (or multiple datasets) and gain insights from it. Students are expected to select datasets that interest them (e.g., remote sensing data, historical energy consumption data from various countries, the distribution of significant earthquakes, global river nutrient fluxes, etc.). Each student will clean their datasets, analyze and explore the data, create visualizations, train a machine learning model, and narrate a story (i.e., interpret the data). Students will submit the R scripts with all the code and analysis and present a brief (~10-minute) overview of their project to the class. Presentation duration is subject to change. Students are highly encouraged to consult with the instructor when selecting their project topics.",

They are for the sole use of students currently enrolled in this class and may be subject to copyright. If you take materials provided for this class electronically and then post them to the web in return for monetary compensation, you may be violating copyright, particularly if you include images and PowerPoint slides provided by the professor.\n\n\nStudents in Need of Disability-Related Academic Accommodations\nSyracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. There may be aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course. I invite any student to contact me to discuss strategies and/or accommodations (academic adjustments) that may be essential to your success and to collaborate with the Center for Disability Resources (CDR) in this process. If you would like to discuss disability-accommodations or register with CDR, please visit Center for Disability Resources. Please call (315) 443-4498 or email disabilityresources@syr.edu for more detailed information. The CDR is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic accommodations and will work with the student to develop an access plan. Academic accommodations, such as exam administration, are not provided retroactively; therefore, planning for accommodations as early as possible is necessary.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nSyracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy reflects the high value that we, as a university community, place on honesty in academic work. The policy defines our expectations for academic honesty and holds students accountable for the integrity of all work they submit. Students should understand that it is their responsibility to learn about course-specific expectations, as well as about university-wide academic integrity expectations. The policy governs appropriate citation and use of sources, the integrity of work submitted in exams and assignments, and the veracity of signatures on attendance sheets and other verification of participation in class activities. The policy also prohibits students from submitting the same work in more than one class without receiving written authorization in advance from both instructors. Under the policy, students found in violation are subject to grade sanctions determined by the course instructor and non-grade sanctions determined by the School or College where the course is offered as described in the Violation and Sanction Classification Rubric. Syracuse University students are required to read an online summary of the University’s academic integrity expectations and provide an electronic signature agreeing to abide by them twice a year during pre-term check- in on MySlice.\nThe Violation and Sanction Classification Rubric establishes recommended guidelines for the determination of grade penalties by faculty and instructors, while also giving them discretion to select the grade penalty they believe most suitable, including course failure, regardless of violation level. Any established violation in this course may result in course failure regardless of violation level.\nAll academic integrity expectations that apply to in-person quizzes and exams also apply to online quizzes and exams. In this course, all work submitted for quizzes and exams must be yours alone. Discussing quiz or exam questions with anyone during the quiz or exam period violates academic integrity expectations for this course. Using websites that charge fees or require uploading of course material (e.g., Chegg, Course Hero) to obtain exam solutions or assignments completed by others and present the work as your own violates academic integrity expectations in this course.\n\n\nFaith Tradition Observances\nSU’s religious observances policy, found at SU website, recognizes the diversity of faiths represented in the campus community and protects the rights of students, faculty, and staff to observe religious holy days according to their tradition. Syracuse University does not set aside non-instructional days for any religious holiday. Students must notify instructors by the end of the second week of classes when they will be observing their religious holiday(s). Students will have access to an online notification form through MySlice for two weeks beginning on the first day of class. Once I have been notified of your intention to be absent for a religious observance, I will work with you directly to find a way to accommodate your absence.\n\n\nClass Absences and Associated Missed Work\nExcuses for class absences for medical reasons will be given only if such absences are advised by a health care provider at the Health Center, based on clinical findings and prescribed treatment recommendations. Excused notes will not be given solely to confirm a visit to the Health Center. For complete details on excuse notes, visit this [SU website].\n\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\nSyracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. There may be aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course. I invite any student to contact me to discuss strategies and/or accommodations (academic adjustments) that may be essential to your success and to collaborate with the Center for Disability Resources (CDR) in this process.\nIf you would like to discuss disability-accommodations or register with CDR, please visit Center for Disability Resources. Please call (315) 443-4498 or email disabilityresources@syr.edu for more detailed information.\nThe CDR is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic accommodations and will work with the student to develop an access plan. Since academic accommodations may require early planning and generally are not provided retroactively, please contact CDR as soon as possible to begin this process.\n\n\nDiscrimination or Harassment\nThe University does not discriminate and prohibits harassment or discrimination related to any protected category including creed, ethnicity, citizenship, sexual orientation, national origin, sex, gender, pregnancy, disability, marital status, age, race, color, veteran status, military status, religion, sexual orientation, domestic violence status, genetic information, gender identity, gender expression or perceived gender. Any complaint of discrimination or harassment related to any of these protected bases should be reported to Sheila Johnson-Willis, the University’s Chief Equal Opportunity & Title IX Officer. She is responsible for coordinating compliance efforts under various laws including Titles VI, VII, IX and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. She can be contacted at Equal Opportunity, Inclusion, and Resolution Services, 005 Steele Hall, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY 13244-1120; by email: titleix@syr.edu; or by telephone: 315-443-0211.\n\n\nEducational Use of Student Work\nI intend to use academic work that you complete this semester for educational purposes in this course during this semester. Your registration and continued enrollment constitute your permission. I intend to use academic work that you complete this semester in subsequent semesters for educational purposes. Before using your work for that purpose, I will either get your written permission or render the work anonymous by removing identifying material.",

This course is offered through the HydroLearn platform, in partnership with CUAHSI HydroShare\nThis course is designed to serve a broad mix of learners whose coding expertise ranges from beginner to expert level and whose geoscience-related research interests. At the end of this course, you should be able to describe and implement the steps involved in:\n\nreviewing and modifying others’ codes in R and/or Python\nwriting codes in R and/or Python\ndeveloping and implementing a data science workflow for a data-driven project\ndesigning a data science project by conceptualizing a domain science problem\n\nThis will be accomplished through activities within each section. Results from each activity will be recorded in specified results templates. The results templates for each activity can be found at the beginning of each activity. The results templates are organized such that results from one activity can easily be used in successive activities.\n\n\n\nThis image was created with the assistance of DALL·E"
