We are a group of geoscientists and environmental data scientists in the [Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences](https://artsandsciences.syracuse.edu/earth-sciences-department/){target="_blank"} at [Syracuse University](https://www.syracuse.edu){target="_blank"}. Our research interests involve studying water and elemental cycles within coupled human and natural systems across varying temporal and spatial scales using both data science (big data) and case study (small data) approaches. In our research, we develop and blend field-based, laboratory-based, and data-driven tools.
